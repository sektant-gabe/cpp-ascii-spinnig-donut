## How the Universe Actually Works? 

**(SPOILERS ALERT)**

The movie "Everything, everywhere all at once" literally explains how the universe works. Here is the movie summary:

> In the alpha verse, Alpha!Joy's self was split across every single version of herself at once, giving her godlike powers, as well as godlike omniscience/omnipresence, and turning her into [Jobu Tupaki](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Jobu+Tupaki+meaning&cId=53b5a63c-4b89-4837-b4df-0f1fe792ca5b&iId=15637066-06e4-4e99-8dec-cb05439dbffb). But the Alpha!Joy was only human, and so it was too painful for her to experience all of this. There were a few moments when she felt okay but ultimately there was too much suffering and meaninglessness - and so she breaks, and becomes a chaotic nihilist, believing that nothing matters.
> 
> As a result, she used her god-like powers to put every single thing in every single universe together all at once. A literal "everything" bagel - an object that has "everything." Like an inverse black hole. She intended to put herself through the bagel in an attempt to die/erase herself/erase everything. It was a method of suicide for a god, essentially.
> 
> The [Everything Bagel](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Everything+Bagel+meaning&cId=b6f4ca32-7db8-4169-bf6b-8b227140f92a&iId=851b2ed8-5208-46ae-b675-b51e937191ae) was also a way for her to force Evelyn to experience what Jobu Tupaki experiences every second of her existence. This can be seen as Jobu Tupaki taking revenge on Evelyn, the person who forced her to verse jump until she split completely and became a god. And as we see, when Evelyn gazes into the Everything Bagel, she encounters existential despair and becomes nihilist instantly - it is simply too much for one human being to be able to cope with. Evelyn fucks up across the multiverse because she no longer cares who she hurts, even herself - revealing Raccacoonie, rejecting businessman Waymond, breaking up with hot-dog-fingers Deirdre, divorcing Waymond and smashing up the laundromat. At that point Jobu Tupaki reveals that she doesn't just want Evelyn to experience what she experiences, but to die together through entering the Bagel. This hints that Jobu Tupaki still wants her mother's approval, and confirms that she longs to not be alone in her suffering.
> 
> However, Evelyn's connection to Waymond, her desire to stand up to her father, and her sorrow for her daughter, cause her to choose to focus in on the moments where things do make sense and she can feel joy and connection to others. She uses these things to try to fix the things she broke across the multiverse, helping the chef get Raccacoonie back, asking businessman Waymond for another chance, getting back together with hot-dog-fingers Deirdre, and finally, apologising - in her own way - to Joy, connecting to Deirdre, showing affection to Waymond, and standing up to her father. (Phew!) In these moments, everything makes sense and there's no more senseless pain, even though these are only a few possibilities out of endless examples of misery. And Evelyn can only make these decisions because she has broken the endlessly repeating cycle of her life by seeing how different things might have been in the Bagel.
> 
> The Everything Bagel is endless misery surrounding a faint glimmer of peace that can only be found in death. But the [Googly Eye](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Googly+Eye+meaning&cId=194b65d4-bc53-40ba-b3d9-d51329295dad&iId=ec2ff9ff-374b-410a-bb4a-0ee9e94d86fa) is delight, joy, love, and connection surrounding an endless black void. They're yin and yang. When Evelyn sticks the Googly Eye on her forehead at the end, it's more than a third eye reference. She's showing Jobu Tupaki that what they saw in the Bagel is true - there is endless misery and meaninglessness in every possible version of reality. But, it's also possible to see the reverse - because nothing matters, everything does, and meaning can only be made out of chaos. Random, but it's kinda like the reverse of Syndrome's thing in The Incredibles - "when everyone's super, no one will be." But the reverse is also true. If no one is super, anyone can be a superhero.
> 
> So the Everything Bagel is mostly symbolic - it's Joy's depression, it's nihilism, hopelessness, chaos, disorder, and despair. It's too much to cope with and it's Everything. And the Googly Eye really is just a symbol. It's wonder, joy, love, connection, kindness, and hope. It's only little bits at a time, which makes it just enough to keep going, because it can be comprehended.
